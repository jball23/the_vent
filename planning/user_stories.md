THE VENT - User Stories

1.  As a user, I would like to be able to quickly add a "vent" so I don't
    lose any steam on my way to the form and I can get my thoughts down
    quickly.
2.  As a user, I would like to be able to view other people's vents so
    that I might find someone else who is feeling something similar to me
    and connect with them.
3.  As a user, I would like the ability to edit my vent in case it can portray
    my thoughts/feelings as accurately as possible, and I might not always get it right the first time I write it.
4.  As a user, I would like the ability to delete my vent because sometimes it
    might be a bad idea to keep a vent up.
5.  As a user, I would like to be able to comment on vents to either encourage
    the person or fan the flame.
6.  As a user, I would like to be able to edit my comment because it might not
    be appropriate or exactly what I wanted to say at the time.
7.  As a user, I would like to be able to delete my comment for the same
    reason as above.
